1.- Ok let's now add a practicante class with this Icon (add it to the menu and legends, and readme)🚶‍♂️:

2.- The "practicante" (intern) starts in a room and has the same movements but doesn't activate a sensor.

3.- The intern can't start in a room that already has a zombie in it.

4.- The intern will never mover towards a zombie if they are in adyacent rooms. He will move away (if possible) or stay in that same room. The only option of interaction is that the zombie reaches the intern. 

5.- If a zombie reaches the intern, then it's game over. The game over message and condition must be different than the one with the infested rooms.
